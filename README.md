## What Ghostty Dev adds

This fork extends the sidebar-enabled Ghostty with productivity features for developers who use the terminal as a workspace — especially those running [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) sessions across multiple tabs.

### Real-Time Progress Log

Each tab displays a live progress log overlay on the first pane, updated via a file-based API. Claude Code (or any script) can push timestamped status entries that appear instantly in the UI.

- **File-backed** — log files at `/tmp/ghostty-progress/{session}.log`, one per tab
- **Real-time** — Swift uses `DispatchSource` (kqueue) to detect file changes, zero polling
- **8 lines visible** — latest entries shown, newest first; full history in file
- **Read-only display** — clean, distraction-free status view
- **Per-tab isolation** — each tab has its own log keyed by session name (e.g. `GHOSTTYDEV-3A7F2B1C`)

Install the bundled CLI and skill (see [Installation](#installation)), and Claude Code will automatically log progress when tasks start or complete.

### Snippets

User-defined commands shared across all tabs. Click a snippet to send the command text to the terminal.

- **Add** — right-click any tab or sidebar empty area → "Add Snippet..."
- **Edit/Delete** — right-click a snippet in the action popover
- **Persistent** — stored at `~/.config/ghosttydev/snippets.json`
- **No auto-execute** — text is inserted without a trailing newline

### Sidebar Action Popover

Quick actions accessible via the `>` chevron on the selected tab card:

- **Resume tmux** — attach to the tab's tmux session (creates if needed)
- **Launch CC** — start Claude Code inside the tmux session
- **Detach tmux** — detach without killing the session
- **Snippets** — user-defined commands listed below built-in actions
- **Auto-dismiss** — popover closes after button click

### Native Settings Window

`Cmd+,` opens a proper macOS settings window (replaces opening the config file).

- **System tab** — edit config.ghostty settings (window-save-state, app icon style/colors/frame)
- **Ghostty Dev tab** — toggle progress badge, card border, font size
- **"Open Config File..."** — quick access to manual config editing
- **Safe sync** — preserves comments and unknown keys in config file

### Tmux Session Management

Each tab automatically gets a named tmux session with a `GHOSTTYDEV-` prefix for easy identification:

- **Named sessions** — e.g. `GHOSTTYDEV-3A7F2B1C` (derived from pane UUID)
- **Idempotent** — `tmux new-session -A` creates or attaches
- **`tmux ls` friendly** — all Ghostty sessions are instantly recognizable

### Stable Sidebar Tab Info

Sidebar tab cards always display metadata from the **leftmost pane**, regardless of which pane has focus. No more info jumping around when switching between splits.

### Per-Tab Notes Panel

Toggle a side panel per tab to jot down notes, commands, or context — persisted across restarts.

- **Toggle:** `Cmd+Shift+N` or View menu → Toggle Notes
- **Per-tab isolation** — each tab has its own notes
- **Persistent** — notes saved to `~/.config/ghosttydev/notes/` as individual files

### Task Title Bar

A thin bar at the top of the first pane displaying the current task context (e.g. Linear issue, project name).

- **Toggle:** `Cmd+Shift+M` or View menu (hidden by default)
- **Color strip** — visual indicator matching the tab color
- **Overlay** — only covers the first pane, second pane gets full height

### Independent Session Persistence

Replaced macOS `NSWindowRestoration` with a custom JSON-based session persistence system.

- **Restart-idempotent** — multiple restarts produce the exact same window/tab state
- **Saves on every state change** — tab reorder, title change, panel toggle
- **Tab order preserved** — tabs restore in the correct sequence
- **Isolated storage** — session data at `~/.config/ghosttydev/session.json`

### Ghostty Dev Variant

Runs as a separate app alongside the official Ghostty:

- **Distinct bundle ID and display name** (`Ghostty Dev`)
- **Separate config directory** (`~/.config/ghosttydev/`)
- **Swift 6.2 / Xcode 16.3 compatible**

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- macOS 13+
- Xcode 16.3+ (Swift 6.2)
- Zig 0.15+ (for building the Zig core / libghostty)
- tmux (for session management)
- Python 3 (for progress log CLI)

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/ghostty-dev.git
cd ghostty-dev

# Build Zig core (libghostty) → outputs macos/GhosttyKit.xcframework
zig build -Demit-xcframework=true -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# Build Swift app (links against the xcframework above)
xcodebuild -project "macos/Ghostty Dev.xcodeproj" \
    -scheme "Ghostty Dev" \
    -configuration Release \
    -derivedDataPath /tmp/ghostty-build build

# Deploy to /Applications (must remove old copy first — see note below)
rm -rf "/Applications/Ghostty Dev.app"
cp -R "/tmp/ghostty-build/Build/Products/Release/Ghostty Dev.app" \
    "/Applications/Ghostty Dev.app"
codesign --force --deep --sign - "/Applications/Ghostty Dev.app"
```

> **Why `zig build` first?** The app has two compilation stages: Zig core (`libghostty.a`) and Swift frontend. `xcodebuild` only compiles Swift and links against the existing xcframework — it does not rebuild the Zig core. Skipping `zig build` means new Zig-side features won't take effect.

> **Why remove before copy?** The app is ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer certificate). macOS caches code signature validation per bundle path. If you overwrite an existing `.app` with `cp -R` without removing first, macOS may see a Team ID mismatch between the cached signature of the old binary and the newly copied Sparkle.framework, causing a **DYLD crash at launch** (`Library not loaded: Sparkle.framework ... different Team IDs`). Removing the old `.app` first clears the cached validation.
>
> **Why `codesign --force --deep --sign -` after copy?** This re-signs the entire bundle (including embedded frameworks like Sparkle) with a consistent ad-hoc identity, ensuring all components share the same signature. Running this on the final installed path avoids any path-dependent signing issues.

Ghostty Dev runs alongside the official Ghostty — separate bundle ID, separate config.

### Install the progress log CLI

```bash
cp tools/scripts/ghostty_progress.py ~/.claude/scripts/ghostty_progress.py
chmod +x ~/.claude/scripts/ghostty_progress.py
```

### Install the Claude Code skill

```bash
# Create skills directory if needed
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills

# Symlink so the skill stays in sync with repo updates
ln -s "$(pwd)/tools/skills/progress-update" ~/.claude/skills/progress-update
```

## Upstream Sidebar Features

<details>
<summary>Sidebar tab system (from tomreinert/ghostty)</summary>

Replaces the native tab bar with a left sidebar showing rich tab cards:

- **Title, directory, git branch** — git branch detected automatically, no setup needed
- **Custom status entries** — show ports, environments, or any metadata via CLI
- **Attention indicators** — orange dot on tabs with notifications or bell
- **Drag-and-drop** — reorder tabs by dragging
- **Theme-aware** — colors derived from your terminal theme

#### Config

```
# Choose which fields to show (default: all)
sidebar-fields = title,directory,git-branch,status
```

#### CLI

Install: symlink `cli/ghosttyctl` to somewhere on your PATH (e.g. `~/.local/bin/ghosttyctl`).

```bash
ghosttyctl rename "My Tab"                                    # rename tab
ghosttyctl notify --title "Done" --body "Build finished"      # send notification
ghosttyctl set-status server "localhost:3000" --icon network  # add status entry
ghosttyctl clear-status server                                # remove it
ghosttyctl list                                               # list all tabs
ghosttyctl current                                            # current tab info
```

## About

Ghostty is a terminal emulator that differentiates itself by being
fast, feature-rich, and native. While there are many excellent terminal
emulators available, they all force you to choose between speed,
features, or native UIs. Ghostty provides all three.

In all categories, I am not trying to claim that Ghostty is the
best (i.e. the fastest, most feature-rich, or most native). But
Ghostty is competitive in all three categories and Ghostty
doesn't make you choose between them.

Ghostty also intends to push the boundaries of what is possible with a
terminal emulator by exposing modern, opt-in features that enable CLI tool
developers to build more feature rich, interactive applications.

While aiming for this ambitious goal, our first step is to make Ghostty
one of the best fully standards compliant terminal emulator, remaining
compatible with all existing shells and software while supporting all of
the latest terminal innovations in the ecosystem. You can use Ghostty
as a drop-in replacement for your existing terminal emulator.

Additional details for each step in the big roadmap below:

#### Standards-Compliant Terminal Emulation

Ghostty implements enough control sequences to be used by hundreds of
testers daily for over the past year. Further, we've done a
[comprehensive xterm audit](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/632)
comparing Ghostty's behavior to xterm and building a set of conformance
test cases.

We believe Ghostty is one of the most compliant terminal emulators available.

Terminal behavior is partially a de jure standard
(i.e. [ECMA-48](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-48/))
but mostly a de facto standard as defined by popular terminal emulators
worldwide. Ghostty takes the approach that our behavior is defined by
(1) standards, if available, (2) xterm, if the feature exists, (3)
other popular terminals, in that order. This defines what the Ghostty project
views as a "standard."

#### Competitive Performance

We need better benchmarks to continuously verify this, but Ghostty is
generally in the same performance category as the other highest performing
terminal emulators.

For rendering, we have a multi-renderer architecture that uses OpenGL on
Linux and Metal on macOS. As far as I'm aware, we're the only terminal
emulator other than iTerm that uses Metal directly. And we're the only
terminal emulator that has a Metal renderer that supports ligatures (iTerm
uses a CPU renderer if ligatures are enabled). We can maintain around 60fps
under heavy load and much more generally -- though the terminal is
usually rendering much lower due to little screen changes.

For IO, we have a dedicated IO thread that maintains very little jitter
under heavy IO load (i.e. `cat <big file>.txt`). On benchmarks for IO,
we're usually within a small margin of other fast terminal emulators.
For example, reading a dump of plain text is 4x faster compared to iTerm and
Kitty, and 2x faster than Terminal.app. Alacritty is very fast but we're still
around the same speed (give or take) and our app experience is much more
feature rich.

> [!NOTE]
> Despite being _very fast_, there is a lot of room for improvement here.

#### Richer Windowing Features

The Mac and Linux (build with GTK) apps support multi-window, tabbing, and
splits.

#### Native Platform Experiences

Ghostty is a cross-platform terminal emulator but we don't aim for a
least-common-denominator experience. There is a large, shared core written
in Zig but we do a lot of platform-native things:

- The macOS app is a true SwiftUI-based application with all the things you
  would expect such as real windowing, menu bars, a settings GUI, etc.
- macOS uses a true Metal renderer with CoreText for font discovery.
- The Linux app is built with GTK.

There are more improvements to be made. The macOS settings window is still
a work-in-progress. Similar improvements will follow with Linux.

#### Cross-platform `libghostty` for Embeddable Terminals

In addition to being a standalone terminal emulator, Ghostty is a
C-compatible library for embedding a fast, feature-rich terminal emulator
in any 3rd party project. This library is called `libghostty`.

Due to the scope of this project, we're breaking libghostty down into
separate actually libraries, starting with `libghostty-vt`. The goal of
this project is to focus on parsing terminal sequences and maintaining
terminal state. This is covered in more detail in this
[blog post](https://mitchellh.com/writing/libghostty-is-coming).

`libghostty-vt` is already available and usable today for Zig and C and
is compatible for macOS, Linux, Windows, and WebAssembly. At the time of
writing this, the API isn't stable yet and we haven't tagged an official
release, but the core logic is well proven (since Ghostty uses it) and
we're working hard on it now.

The ultimate goal is not hypothetical! The macOS app is a `libghostty` consumer.
The macOS app is a native Swift app developed in Xcode and `main()` is
within Swift. The Swift app links to `libghostty` and uses the C API to
render terminals.

## Crash Reports

Ghostty has a built-in crash reporter that will generate and save crash
reports to disk. The crash reports are saved to the `$XDG_STATE_HOME/ghostty/crash`
directory. If `$XDG_STATE_HOME` is not set, the default is `~/.local/state`.
**Crash reports are _not_ automatically sent anywhere off your machine.**

Crash reports are only generated the next time Ghostty is started after a
crash. If Ghostty crashes and you want to generate a crash report, you must
restart Ghostty at least once. You should see a message in the log that a
crash report was generated.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Use the `ghostty +crash-report` CLI command to get a list of available crash
> reports. A future version of Ghostty will make the contents of the crash
> reports more easily viewable through the CLI and GUI.

Crash reports end in the `.ghosttycrash` extension. The crash reports are in
[Sentry envelope format](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/). You can
upload these to your own Sentry account to view their contents, but the format
is also publicly documented so any other available tools can also be used.
The `ghostty +crash-report` CLI command can be used to list any crash reports.
A future version of Ghostty will show you the contents of the crash report
directly in the terminal.

To send the crash report to the Ghostty project, you can use the following
CLI command using the [Sentry CLI](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/installation/):

```shell-session
SENTRY_DSN=https://e914ee84fd895c4fe324afa3e53dac76@o4507352570920960.ingest.us.sentry.io/4507850923638784 sentry-cli send-envelope --raw <path to ghostty crash>
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> The crash report can contain sensitive information. The report doesn't
> purposely contain sensitive information, but it does contain the full
> stack memory of each thread at the time of the crash. This information
> is used to rebuild the stack trace but can also contain sensitive data
> depending on when the crash occurred.
